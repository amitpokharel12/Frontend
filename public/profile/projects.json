      "bodyText": "Utilized a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (QNN) to classify quantum states as entangled or separable, leveraging simulated datasets and key quantum features like purity, von Neumann entropy, and fidelity. Simulated a dataset of 100,000 quantum states using Qiskit, with feature extraction performed through quantum circuits. Achieved 80% accuracy.",
