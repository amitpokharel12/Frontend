         "Quantum entanglement, a nonclassical correlation between quantum subsystems, is fundamental to quantum information science and technologies like quantum teleportation, computing, and sensing. Since the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox and Bell's inequality experiments, entanglement has challenged classical notions of locality, enabling high-dimensional entanglement in systems like photons and cold atoms. Its potential to revolutionize information processing necessitates deeper research into its properties and applications.",
         "We have used a Hybrid Quantum Neural Network (QNN) to classify quantum states as entangled or not. Dataset are Simulated using Qiskit, quantum states are analyzed using features such as Flattened State, purity, and von Neumann entropy ,fidelity, eigenvalues of the partially transposed density matrix. A quantum circuit extracts key features, while classical neural layers refine the classification.",
         "It was trained on  dataset of 100,000 quantum states, the hybrid model achieves high accuracy, with performance evaluated using training-validation loss trends, accuracy metrics, and a confusion matrix."
